				So in the videos we were learning from, the teacher decided to put a link to the company he works for. Now, I could have redirected anyone clinking the button towards where I work (i.e. IESEG at the moment), but I felt better writing this page. So I wrote this page. And once the page was written I felt bad for not using it. So I used it.
